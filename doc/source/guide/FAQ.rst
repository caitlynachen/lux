Troubleshooting Tips
-------------------

- The Jupyter widget does not show up when I print a dataframe.
    - Output message "A Jupyter widget could not be displayed because the widget state could not be found. This could happen if the kernel storing the widget is no longer available, or if the widget state was not saved in the notebook. You may be able to create the widget by running the appropriate cells."
    - Output message "LuxWidget(...)"
- When I print out the dataframe, the cell is taking a long time to run.
- I have a question or bug that is not addressed by any of the FAQs.
